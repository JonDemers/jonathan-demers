# <div align="center">LEAD/SENIOR JAVA DEVELOPER</div>

Please consider my candidacy for the role of **Lead/Senior Java Developer**. Throughout 18 years experience in software development, including 12 years as senior consultant for multiple businesses, I acquired rich and diversified experience.

This diversity of practical knowledge gives me a clear vision not only on the best technology to accomplish a given goal, but also on the best team structures and strategies to deliver value for businesses and customers.  

I am fully bilingual in French and English and I have many sought-after leadership skills, which makes me a great fit for this role. I’d be glad to schedule a time to discuss about this position of **Lead/Senior Java Developer**. I am eager to accomplish new challenges as early as **June 29 2020**.

Jonathan Demers, Eng.
